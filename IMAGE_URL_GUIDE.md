# Image URL Guide for Mini CMS

## How to Use Image URLs

Your CMS now supports image URLs from anywhere on the internet! Simply paste the direct image URL into the "Image URL" field when creating or editing posts.

## ✅ What Works

The image URL feature now includes:
- **Live Preview**: See your image before saving the post
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if image fails to load
- **Any Image Source**: Works with images from any website (if they allow embedding)

## 🌐 Free Image Sources

Here are some great websites where you can get free, high-quality images:

### 1. **Unsplash** (https://unsplash.com)
- Right-click on any image → "Copy image address"
- Example: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-xxxxx`

### 2. **Pexels** (https://www.pexels.com)
- Click on an image → Right-click → "Copy image address"
- Example: `https://images.pexels.com/photos/xxxxx`

### 3. **Pixabay** (https://pixabay.com)
- Free images, right-click to copy image URL
- Example: `https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/xxxxx`

### 4. **Imgur** (https://imgur.com)
- Upload your own images and get direct links
- Example: `https://i.imgur.com/xxxxx.jpg`

### 5. **Picsum Photos** (https://picsum.photos)
- Random placeholder images
- Example: `https://picsum.photos/800/600`

## 📝 How to Get Image URLs

### Method 1: Right-Click (Recommended)
1. Find an image you like on any website
2. Right-click on the image
3. Select "Copy image address" or "Copy image link"
4. Paste into the Image URL field in your CMS

### Method 2: Open in New Tab
1. Right-click on an image
2. Select "Open image in new tab"
3. Copy the URL from the browser address bar
4. Paste into your CMS

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Use HTTPS URLs**: Always use `https://` instead of `http://` for better security
- **Direct Image Links**: Make sure the URL ends with an image extension (.jpg, .png, .gif, .webp)
- **CORS Issues**: Some websites block their images from being embedded on other sites
- **Image Size**: Use reasonably sized images (under 2MB) for faster loading

## 🎨 Recommended Image Sizes

- **Thumbnail**: 800x600 pixels
- **Featured Image**: 1200x800 pixels
- **Banner**: 1920x1080 pixels

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Image not showing?**
- Check if the URL is correct and accessible
- Make sure it's a direct image link (ends with .jpg, .png, etc.)
- Try opening the URL in a new browser tab to verify it works
- Some websites block external embedding - try a different source

**Preview not working?**
- The preview feature requires a valid HTTP/HTTPS URL
- Wait a moment for the image to load
- If it doesn't appear, the URL might be invalid or blocked

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use Unsplash or Pexels** for professional, high-quality images
2. **Test the URL** by opening it in a new tab before saving
3. **Keep URLs short** by using URL shorteners if needed
4. **Organize images** by category or topic for easier management
5. **Use consistent aspect ratios** for a cleaner look on your site
